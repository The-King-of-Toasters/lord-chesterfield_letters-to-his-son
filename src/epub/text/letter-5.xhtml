			<p>I told you, my dear, that I would send you some stories to amuse you; I therefore now give you the history of the siege of Troy, which is very entertaining. Homer, an ancient Greek poet, has wrote upon this subject the finest epic poem that ever was. By the way, you are to know than an epic poem is a long poem upon some great event, or upon the actions of some great man.</p>
			<p>The siege of Troy is so very famous for having lasted ten years, and also upon the account of the great number of heroes who were there, that one must by no means be ignorarnt of such an event. When you are older, you will read it all in the Greek of Homer.</p>
			<p>Adieu! you are the best child in the world.</p>
			<p>I return you your letter corrected; for though it had but few faults, it is however proper that you should know them.</p>

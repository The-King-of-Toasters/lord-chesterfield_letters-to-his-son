			<p>Your last letter afforded me very great satisfaction, both as it was elegantly penned, and because you promise in it, to take great pains to attain deservedly true praise. But I must tell you ingenuously, that I suspect very much your having had, in composing it, the assistance of a good and able master; under whose conduct and instruction it will be your own fault if you do not acquire elegancy of style, learning, and, in short, every thing else becoming a wise and virtuous person. I earnestly entreat you, therefore, to imitate carefully so good a pattern; and the more attention and regard you shew for him, the more I shall think you love and respect me.</p>
			<p>I shall continue here a fortnight longer, drinking these waters, before I return to town; let me then find you sensibly improved in your learning. You must summon greater resolution and diligence. I shall bring you presents from hence, which you shall receive as rewards of your application and industry, provided I find you deserving of them; if otherwise, expect reproof and chastisement for your sloth. Farewell.</p>

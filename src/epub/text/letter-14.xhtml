			<p>I am glad to hear you study the Roman history; for, of all ancient histories, it is the most instructive, and furnishes most examples of virtue, wisdom, and courage. The other great empires, as the Assyrian, Persian, and Macedonian, sprung up almost of a sudden, by favourable accidents, and the rapidity of their conquests; but the Roman empire extended itself gradually, and surmounted the obstacles that opposed its aggrandisement, not less by virtue and wisdom, than by force of arms.</p>
			<p>Rome, which at length became the mistress of the world, was (as you know) in the beginning but a emall city, founded by Romulus, her first king, at the head of an inconsiderable number of herdsmen and vagabonds, who had made him their chief. At the first survey Romulus made of his people; that is, the first time he took an account of the inhabitants, they amounted only to three thousand foot, and three hundred horse; whereas, towards the end of his reign, which lasted thirty-seven years, he reckoned forty-six thousand foot and one thousand horse.</p>
			<p>During the first two hundred and fifty years of Rome, as long as it was governed by kings, the Romans were engaged in frequent wars with their neighbours; who endeavoured to crush in its infancy a state whose future greatness they dreaded, as the natural consequence of its virtue, courage and wisdom.</p>
			<p>Thus Rome employed its first two hundred and fifty years in struggling with the neighbouring states, who were in that period entirely subdued; and two hundred and fifty more in conquering the rest of Italy; so that we reckon five hundred years from the foundation of Rome to the entire conquest of Italy. And in the following two hundred years she attained to the empire of the world; that is, in seven hundred years from the foundation of the city.</p>

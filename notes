As for the source text, there are two editions I'm focusing on

- "The Works of Lord Chesterfield" by Harper & Brothers, published various times in the 1800s.
- "Lord Chesterfield's Letters" Oliver H. G. Leigh, published in 1901[1]. This
  seems to be based off the Harper edition. The book splits the letters from
  before 1750 into the juvenile section. This is the basis of the Gutenberg
  transcription, but it only contains the first 320 letters.

Misc oddities
